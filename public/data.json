They get more people into cycling and that's a win in our book! But just how fast can they be? In a previous video Hank managed to beat his dad, George, who was riding an E-Bike but hadn't ridden a bike in 20 years. We decided it was high time for a rematch, but this time George had an ace up his sleeve - he would be riding a de-restricted Canyon Grail On E-Bike to give Hank a proper test and see who would come out on top!
